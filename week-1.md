# Week 1 Lab Report
*This is a tutorial on logging into a course specific account on ieng6*

Before logging on make sure you know your username/password and have Visual Studio Code downloaded. 

## If you don't know your username/password: 
Go to this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and look up your account username. If this is the first time you are logging on, you will need to reset your password in order to log in. Since it was my first time logging on, I had to reset my password. For CSE 15L, your username will start with this phrase: *cs15lwi23*, just like my account. 

## If you need to download Visual Studio Code: 
Go to this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the necessary version for your operating system. The website should give options as shown in the image below.

## How to log into your course specific account on ieng6: 
Now that you have your account and Visual Studio Code, you are ready to log into your account. First, open up a terminal in Visual Studio Code. For Macs, it should be on a bar at the top, as shown in the image below (I am doing this on a Mac, so this image is what I see). 

*However, for windows users, you will first need to install git for Windows using this [link](https://gitforwindows.org/). After installing that, set your default terminal to git bash in Visual Studio Code*

When your terminal is open, type in this command, replacing zz with the letters of your own account: *$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu* (without the dollar sign, as it's not part of the command it is just there to denote that this is the command). When you do that, your terminal should give you a message like the one in the image below. I typed "yes" to resolve this message and moved on.

Then, it will ask for your password and you should type it in and click "enter". You should get a message like the one in the image below (this is the message I received with my account, but yours will be slightly different). If you got this message, it means you have successfully logged in!

## Trying some commands on terminal: 
You can run commands in the terminal and even open more terminals if needed/wanted! Here are some of the commands I ran in my terminal. I went in and out of some directories and saw the files inside them.
