# Week 8 Lab Report
This is a report on how I completed the competition tasks outlined below: 

## Task 4: Log into ieng6

For this task, I ran the command $ ssh cs15lwi23ate@ieng6.ucsd.edu and the account logged in immediately. This is because I had generated an SSH key for ieng6 and now I do not need to put in a password to log in everytime.

## Task 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

For this task I used the command $ git clone and I cloned the link under the SSH tab. This is because I had generated an SSH key for github earlier to access and write data into repositories from my computer. Now I can access github from my course specific account on ieng6.


- Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
- Edit the code file to fix the failing test
- Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
